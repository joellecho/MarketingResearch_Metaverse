Marketing Research on Consumers' Perception of Metaverse

This Research was conducted to study Consumers' Perception of Metaverse using Marketng Research Methods. 
Statistical Analysis methods(cronbach alpha test, simple linear regression, paired sample t test) were used to test the 4 hypotheses. 
Totla 67 samples were collected through the online survey that I conducted on qualtrics.com, and the software SPSS was used to analyze and visualize the data.

After combining all these statistical analysis results above, we could conclude that consumer’s acknowledgment that measures the effectiveness of the metaverse positively affects consumers’ intention to use the metaverse. Consumers showed more positive perceptions of a brand that is using the metaverse compared to a brand that does not have a presence in the metaverse. As we confirmed above, Perceived resource effectiveness of the metaverse positively affects consumers in the education industry as well. Lastly, we could’ve confirmed that the influence of social media helps the metaverse become more known to the public throughout the survey.
